# Why a Separate Package?

In Many projects related to Laravel of Bangladesh Krishi Bank, often Offices are needed along with their
types, lists, options (for dropdowns) etc. It's a repeating task and time-consuming. So, it's better to make
a separate repository for this task.

Also, it's a quicker solution to adopt or remove this feature just by installing or uninstalling the package in a
project.

The package also provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for offices, types etc. So, managing
offices list is going to be really a simple task.

Also, when the package is going to be used in multiple projects, all those projects will work on same office database
ids.
